# KafkaPubliser
It is a "KafkaPublisher" application, publishes Customer (id,name,city) type of data to Kafka server.
kafka server receive the data and forward it to another application- "KafkaSubscriber".
Kafka is a Opensource Distributed EventStreaming Platform.
I have used PostMan tool to provide input to the application.
